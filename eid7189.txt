It should say:

   One-octet Element IDs MUST be allocated in the range 0x80 - 0xFE.  These items are
   valuable because they are short, and they need to be used for
   commonly repeated elements.  Element IDs are to be allocated within
   this range according to the "RFC Required" policy [RFC8126].

   The following one-octet Element ID is RESERVED: 0xFF.

   Values in the one-octet range of 0x00 - 0x7F are not valid for use
   as Element IDs.

   Two-octet Element IDs MUST be allocated in the range 0x407F - 0x7FFE.  Element IDs
   are to be allocated within this range according to the "Specification
   Required" policy [RFC8126].

   The following two-octet Element ID is RESERVED: 0x7FFF.

   Values in the two-octet ranges of 0x0100 - 0x407E and 
   0x8000 - 0xFFFF are not valid for use as  Element IDs.

   Three-octet Element IDs MUST be allocated in the range 0x203FFF - 0x3FFFFE.
   Element IDs are to be allocated within this range according to the
   "First Come First Served" policy [RFC8126].

   The following three-octet Element ID is RESERVED: 0x3FFFFF.

   Values in the three-octet ranges of 0x010000 - 0x203FFE and 
   0x400000 - 0xFFFFFF are not valid for use as Element IDs.

   Four-octet Element IDs MUST be allocated in the range 0x101FFFFF - 0x1FFFFFFE.
   Four-octet Element IDs are somewhat special in that they are useful
   for resynchronizing to major structures in the event of data
   corruption or loss.  As such, four-octet Element IDs are split into
   two categories.  Four-octet Element IDs whose lower three octets (as
   encoded) would make printable 7-bit ASCII values (0x20 to 0x7E,
   inclusive) MUST be allocated by the "Specification Required" policy.
   Sequential allocation of values is not required: specifications
   SHOULD include a specific request and are encouraged to do early
   allocations.

   To be clear about the above category: four-octet Element IDs always
   start with hex 0x10 to 0x1F, and that octet may be chosen so that the
   entire VINT has some desirable property, such as a specific CRC.  The
   other three octets, when ALL having values between 0x20 (32, ASCII
   Space) and 0x7E (126, ASCII "~"), fall into this category.

   Other four-octet Element IDs may be allocated by the "First Come
   First Served" policy.

   The following four-octet Element ID is RESERVED: 0x1FFFFFFF.

   Values in the four-octet ranges of 0x01000000 - 0x101FFFFE and 0x20000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF
   are not valid for use as Element IDs.
